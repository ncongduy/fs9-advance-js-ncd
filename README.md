# Advanced Javascript assignments

## Assignment 1

Write Javascript code that prints out (using `console.log`) a sequence of numbers from 1 to 1000,000 (one million) without blocking the interactions with the browser. For example, while that piece of Javascript is running, mouse, keyboard events etc should work fine and browser doesn't hang.

- Note that while running that code, your CPU usage may reach 100% or over
- Be careful that you may make browser hang while testing.

Write your code in `assignment-1.js` file.

## Assignment 2

Write an ES6 class that does the following:

- Get list of all countries
- Search for a country by full name, either international or native (such as Finland or Suomi, the API has endpoint for this)
- Given a country name, find out what other countries it's bordering with
- Given the code (2 characters) of a language, find out what countries are speaking it (the API has endpoint for this)
- Given a population (in millions), find out what countries have more people than that
