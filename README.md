# Advanced Javascript assignments
Work in pair to finish both assignments. You can both work together on assignments or split the work so that each one (in the same pair) solves a different assignment. Create the PR to upstream once you finish them all.

## Assignment 1
Write Javascript code that prints out (using `console.log`) a sequence of numbers from 1 to 1000,000 (one million) without blocking the interactions with the browser. For example, while that piece of Javascript is running, mouse, keyboard events etc should work fine and browser doesn't hang.

* Note that while running that code, your CPU usage may reach 100% or over
* Be careful that you may make browser hang while testing.

Write your code in `assignment-1.js` file.

## Assignment 2
Write an ES6 class that does the following:

* Get list of all countries
* Search for a country by full name, either international or native (such as Finland or Suomi)
* Given a country name, find out what other countries it's bordering with
* Given the code (2 characters) of a language, find out what countries are speaking it
* Given a population (in millions), find out what countries have more people than that

Countries APIs can be found here: [https://restcountries.eu/](https://restcountries.eu/)

Test your code (to make sure it does the correct things) before creating PR.

Write your code in `assignment-2.js` file.
